User Stories
1. As a resturant owner, I want to have my clients be able to view our resturant through a website so that I can gain client interest before they come into the resturant.
2. As a resturant goer, I want to be able to view the menu and reserve a table so that I can have a table ready for me without a wait and I'll know what food is avalible to eat.
3. As a resturant goer , I want to know the prices of each meal so that I can be prepared to pay for the bill.

Russo's Ristorante is a fictional italian resturant. This website is going to give a home page, menu page and also an about page. The home page will give the view of the resturant, links to the menu and about page. Menu page will give a full view of the menu, showing pictures and price of each item. About page will give a background story of how the resturant was put together and how the family runs the business. It will also give a form to sign up for daily emails from the resturant

There will be 3 navigation links at the top of the page to shift between each page. 

Technologies used are HTML, CSS, README.md

In the future I want to improve the website in many different ways
    1. Make the menu you page more interactive, when you hover over the picture of the item then it will give you a more detailed description of the dish
    2.
