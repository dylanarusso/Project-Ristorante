User Stories
1. As a resturant owner, I want to have my clients be able to view our resturant through a website so that I can gain client interest before they come into the resturant.
2. As a resturant goer, I want to be able to view the menu and reserve a table so that I can have a table ready for me without a wait and I'll know what food is avalible to eat.
3. As a resturant goer , I want to know the prices of each meal so that I can be prepared to pay for the bill.

Russo's Ristorante is a fictional italian resturant. This website is going to give a home page, menu page and also a reservation page. The home page will give the view of the resturant, links to the menu and about page and a simple about me paragraph, it will also give a form to sign up for weekly emails from the resturant. Menu page will give a full view of the menu, showing pictures and price of each item. Reservation page will give a calander for you to select the date you want to come and dine, along with personal information that needs to be filled out to reserve your spot right after you click the submit button.

There will be 3 navigation links at the top of the page to shift between each page. Images will be displayed on each page with .jpg pictures of the resturant and menu items (single pictures and carousel). Email registration text & submit button on homepage. Menu page will display multiple alighned paragraphs with images of the menu. Reservation page will have a calender showing dates & times to pick from but entering your information on required text boxes with a submit button. 

Technologies used are HTML, CSS, README.md, JavaScript, Bootstrap

In the future I want to improve the website in many different ways
    1. Make the menu you page more interactive, when you hover over the picture of the item then it will give you a more detailed description of the dish
    2. Order takeout from the website
    3. Add social website pages, to submit reviews for our resturant
